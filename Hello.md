# Hello - Lionel Richie

(verse)
I've been alone with you inside my mind
And in my dreams, I kissed your lips a thousend times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door

Hello
Is it me you're looking for?
I can see it in your yes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I ever wanted
And my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometime I feel my heart will overflow
